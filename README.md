# Speech Emotion Recognition With DeepLearning

## Overview
This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system that analyzes speech input and classifies it into different emotional states such as happy, sad, angry, etc.

## Algorithm
The system uses [insert algorithm, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), etc.] for emotion classification. The model is trained on a dataset containing speech samples labeled with different emotions.

## Features Extracted
- **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)**
- **Chroma features**
- **Spectral contrast**
- **Tonnetz features**

## Features
- **Speech Input**: The system accepts speech input from various sources such as microphone input or pre-recorded audio files.
- **Emotion Classification**: Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning models, the system classifies the emotional content of the input speech.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Supports real-time analysis for immediate feedback.
- **Scalability**: The current model may face challenges handling large volumes of data, which is an area for future improvement.

## Requirements
- [List of dependencies and requirements]
- [Instructions for installation]

## Usage
1. **Training**: If applicable, provide instructions for training the emotion recognition model.
2. **Inference**: Explain how to use the system for real-time emotion recognition.

## Conclusion
This Speech Emotion Recognition system provides a foundation for analyzing and classifying emotions in speech. While the current model demonstrates promising results, there is potential for further optimization, especially in handling larger datasets and improving scalability.
